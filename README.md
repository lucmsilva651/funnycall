Download all script files here: [DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/lucmsilva651/funnycall/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract then in a folder named *scriptfolder*

## Now, with the updated Python and the script files downloaded, do this:
Open your command prompt and go to the script folder using:
```
cd scriptfolder

Now run to ensure you are in the right folder:
```
